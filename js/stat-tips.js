/* Stat card tooltips: hovering a stat card says what its number shows.
   One handler on the page covers every card, so screens need no extra code, even when they redraw.
   To add wording, add a line below using the card's label in lower case.
   If the same label means something different on one page, add 'page :: label' as well; that line wins.
   A card with no line here shows its own small note, if it has one. */
